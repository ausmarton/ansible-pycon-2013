ansible-pycon-2013
==================

A set of playbooks to support my talk on Ansible at PyCon India 2013.

setup:

1. Install Ansible 1.3
2. Make sure hosts specified in the inventory file are accessible via SSH (the playbooks here are very specific to CentOS 6 hosts, but can be modified for other distros/archs as well)

Details about the talk can be found out here:
